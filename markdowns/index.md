      <p>NFT marketplaces are online platforms that bridge the gap between buyers and sellers. They function more like an exchange, with people minting and selling NFTs at a set price. </p>
      <p>With assetMantle, you can easily create dedicated marketplaces for a wide range of products from specific sellers or groups of sellers. Consider it as Shopify for NFTs where instead of listing products on an ‘Amazon for NFTs’ (such as OpenSea), creators and artists can create their own Shopify-style stores for their specific NFT.</p>
