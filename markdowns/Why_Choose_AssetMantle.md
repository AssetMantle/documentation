AssetMantle envisions changing the landscape of NFT trading for the better.

With never-before-seen features, AssetMantle unleashes the true potential of NFTs for traders and creators alike.

## Complete Customization

AssetMantle empowers creators to build their custom-branded NFT storefronts with zero coding. MantleBuilder is a no-code front-end NFT store builder that gives complete control to creators all the way from layout, branding, and royalty percentage.

## Multi-Chain Access

AssetMantle allows users to use their NFTs across metaverses on different chains thanks to the interoperability facilitated by IBC protocol and interNFT standardization.

## Negligible Minting Fees

AssetMantle uses Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism and is a part of the larger Cosmos ecosystem. Thus users on AssetMantle enjoy very minimal gas fees on transactions.

## Multiple Payment Modes

The Mantle team seeks to accelerate the mass adoption of blockchain by making web 3.0 accessible to all and even easier to build on for creators. As a result, AssetMantle will support payments using traditional CeFi banking methods and cryptocurrencies.

## Salient Features of AssetMantle

### **Minting**

Minting allows a verified creator to simply create/import their assets, work on them & convert them into tradable NFTs which can then be exported to the marketplace

### **Exchange (Bid, Buy, Sell)**

- Using an order-book & signature-based matching
- Multiple asset types supported: Images, Audio, Video, AR/VR, 3D, etc.
- Completely decentralized Web3 based application with no involvement of off-chain or centralized databases
- Built on top of the native InterNFT Standards built by Persistence and the community.

### **Ledger Hardware Support**

Ledger uses state-of-the-art technology to secure your assets and deliver a seamless experience to buy/sell crypto assets. With the recent hacks in wallet-based implementations, it is very important to secure the NFT assets.

AssetMantle now supports the Ledger hardware wallet to store all your NFTs securely and avoid phishing attacks into your wallets.

### **Build Your Very Own Storefront/Marketplace**

MantleBuilder will allow creators to create their own storefronts or NFT marketplaces. This marketplace will further allow users to upload, publish, and sell their minted NFTs.

The storefront will use the underlying protocol level logic to govern the demand & pricing mechanism to control the NFT auction & transactions.

Additional benefits of this marketplace are that economic principles of supply and demand become automatically integrated into the system, allowing the community to determine the fair price of user-generated assets.

### IPFS **Storage Mechanism**

- AssetMantle uses IPFS dedicated gateway to store the asset along with the associated metadata.
- AssetMantle verifies the assets using IPFS to prove the authenticity of the minted NFTs.

### InterNFT Standard

AssetMantle uses interNFT standard for NFT minting. This empowers creators with the unparalleled flexibility of adding up to 22 unique attributes.

Unlike other NFT standards (like ERC-721) where the metadata is at the application level, interNFT standardizes the metadata at the protocol level. This allows the NFTs to be used across blockchains and metaverses within the Cosmos ecosystem without the need for PoS bridges.

The ownership of interNFT is maintained by the interNFT wallet. The combination of interNFT and interNFT wallet allows the ownership of the interNFT to be exchanged across interoperable chains while the execution logic of the NFT is still maintained at the native chain.

### Multiple Independent NFT Modules

AssetMantle features several independent modules for NFT assets such as minting, mutation, and burn logic tool-stack on one hand and a wallet for asset storage and ownership transfer on the other hand. Each of these modules operates independently and can be deployed on different blockchains.

### Singular Representation/Instantiation

NFTs belonging to a specific marketplace within assetMantle are represented/instantiated by the same, immutable hash across several chains.

### Cross-Chain Interoperability

AssetMantle is being bootstrapped on the Cosmos interchain ecosystem, with the marketplace featuring interoperability functionalities that will enable artists and creators to mint on Cosmos and transfer their assets for trading on other IBC connected chains. This functionality will fill the gap of multi-chain composability in the NFT ecosystem.

### Low Minting and Transfer Costs

AssetMantle makes a significant shift to the Tendermint Core consensus engine which uses the exponentially more efficient DPoS consensus mechanism instead of PoW. This significantly lowers the transaction costs eliminating the entry barriers, making the marketplace a level playground for creators and collectors.

### Green Energy and PoS Infrastructure

The AssetMantle chain adopts the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus for the validation of transactions, meaning that it consumes significantly less energy to process transactions, unlike the PoW consensus algorithm. Creators on AssetMantle mint ‘greener’ NFTs in comparison to NFTs on PoW chains.

### Friendly UI/UX

AssetMantle boasts of a user-friendly interface, such that artists and creators can easily set up and customize their storefronts. Collectors will also be easily able to locate collections of their favorite creators from across chains.

AssetMantle web application also enables web 2.0 integration, doing away with the complexities of web 3.0 and providing a smooth on-ramp for newer NFT consumers and producers.

### Support for Multiple Asset Types

Users can mint and trade a wide range of supported assets, including images, audio, video, AR/VR, 3D, etc.

### Native Token

The Mantle token ($MNTL) will empower users with voting rights to take part in decisions or updates that affect the marketplace.

### Inter-chain NFTs with Native Implementation

AssetMantle is aimed at encouraging the mass adoption of cross-chain NFTs with native implementation. The NFT module is implemented at the native application logic level and not at the smart contract level.

Leveraging the chain’s native interoperability protocol, artists and creators can easily transfer NFTs between chains rather than using permissioned smart contract bridges.
