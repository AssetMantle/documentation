# Introduction
AssetMantle has been working behind the scenes to provide support for creators and developers to launch individual marketplaces within the Cosmos ecosystem. Creators have a wide range of tools at their disposal to set up personal storefronts. These tools include an NFT module responsible for minting and burning and a NFT wallet module which enables storage and interchain transfer of NFTs. Both entities run independent of each other.

# What is Persistence?
Persistence is a hybrid protocol that powers open institutional finance by allowing crypto-assets (such as stablecoins) to be borrowed using real-world asset invoices as collateral, bridging the gap between DeFi and traditional finance. Similarly, it employs DeFi capabilities to address real-world financing problems.

Persistence also facilitates effective global capital allocation by letting firms and traders borrow against receivables to satisfy their financing requirements. It intends to enable investors to generate yield by investing in a fundamentally new asset class similar to real-world income-generating assets.

# What are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)?

Starting as colored coins on the Bitcoin Network in 2017, NFTs quickly grew in popularity with the popular collections like CryptoKitties, CryptoPunks on the Ethereum network. Since then, NFTs have been continuously rising. They however gained momentum in March 2021, when the well-known artist Beeple sold his digital collage, Everydays: The First 5000 Days for $69.3 million.

An NFT or a Non-fungible Token is a structured unit of data representing the properties of a unique entity or the entity itself. Iif it’s a digital asset, then all its properties are contained by the NFT. They can also be used to represent real-world assets like arts & collectibles, identity, commoditization and many more.
Challenges of Existing NFT Marketplaces

NFT marketplaces are online platforms that bridge the gap between buyers and sellers. They function more like an exchange, with people minting and selling NFTs at a set price.
However, these markets face a number of significant challenges such as:

- High Gas Costs: They have entry barriers such as acquiring crypto to pay the gas fees (rate on-ramps for first-time users), especially on the Ethereum network.

- Data Persistence: They do not guarantee the security and privacy of the assets being minted as NFTs.

- Interoperability: The majority of NFT marketplaces do not support cross-chain or cross-platform transactions.

- Limited support for asset creation: Most NFT Markets focus on arts, collectibles and their relatable use-cases, neglecting the asset creation process as a major component.

# What is AssetMantle?

AssetMantle is a framework for NFT marketplaces that provides all the elements required to create individual marketplaces. It facilitates the creation (minting) of interoperable NFTs that flow between different blockchains. Moreover, it also supports NFTs ranging from digital art, collectibles to tokenized tickets.

With assetMantle, you can easily create dedicated marketplaces for a wide range of products from specific sellers or groups of sellers. Consider it as Shopify for NFTs where instead of listing products on an ‘Amazon for NFTs’ (such as OpenSea), creators and artists can create their own Shopify-style stores for their specific NFT.
