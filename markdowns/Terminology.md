# Terminology

### Non-Fungible Tokens
An NFT or a Non-fungible Token is a structured unit of data representing the properties of a unique entity or the entity itself (if it is a digital asset, then all its properties are contained by the NFT).
### InterNFT
An interNFT is the implementation of the NFT interface. The interNFT interface is designed to provide maximum application logic freedom in a single interface, focusing on interchain ownership transfer. NFT will be used in this text to refer to a straightforward interface, the implementation of which will categorize a structure as an NFT.
### Storefronts
AssetMantle components enable artists and makers to open their Storefronts. Consider this as the Shopify for NFTs where the project is open-source, allowing anybody to create an on-chain interface to represent their specialized assets in the form of modular NFTs. Artists, curators, and collectors may quickly build their stores with the ability to tailor them to their demands.
### IPFS
IPFS is a distributed system that allows users to store and access files, webpages, apps, and other data.

### Stablecoins
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose prices are intended to be tied to another cryptocurrency, fiat currency, or exchange-traded commodities, and their value remains stable.
### Asset Tokenization
Asset tokenization is how an issuer produces digital tokens that represent either digital or tangible assets on a distributed ledger or blockchain.
### Interchain
InterChain is a blockchain that links all SubChains together.
### Coin Burning
Coin burning is the technique by which cryptocurrency miners and developers remove a set percentage of coins from circulation to regulate their price.
### PoS (Proof of Stake)
Proof of stake is a consensus process that is used to validate bitcoin transactions. Owners of cryptocurrencies can stake their coins in this system, allowing them to review new blocks of transactions and add them to the blockchain.
### Web 2.0
Web 2.0 is the second stage of internet development, distinguished mainly by the shift from static web pages to dynamic or user-generated content and the advent of social media.

### Web 3.0
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, dubbed Web 3.0 the Semantic Web to create a more autonomous, intelligent, and open internet.
The description of Web 3.0 may be broadened as follows: data would be networked in a decentralized manner, which would be a significant improvement over our present generation of the internet (Web 2.0), where data is largely held in centralized repositories.

### Ledger Hardware Wallet
Ledger’s hardware wallets are multi-currency wallets that enable the offline storage of cryptocurrency private keys. Ledger’s hardware wallets are device-based, which means they keep private keys on storage devices such as USB drives, which makes it more difficult for hackers to obtain the key from an internet location.
