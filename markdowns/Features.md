# Features

## Minting
*  Minting allows a verified creator to create/import their assets, work on them & convert them into tradable NFTs, which can then be exported to the marketplace.

## Exchange (Bid, Buy, Sell)
-   Order-book & signature-based matching.
-   Multiple asset type support: Images, Audio, Video, AR/VR, 3D, etc.
-   Completely decentralized Web3 based application with no involvement of off-chain or centralized databases.
-   Built on top of the native InterNFT Standards created by Persistence and the community.

## Ledger Hardware Support
Ledger uses state-of-the-art technology to store security measures for securing users' assets and have a seamless experience buying and selling crypto assets.
With the recent hacks in wallet-based implementations, it is essential to secure the NFT assets.
AssetMantle now supports the ledger wallet to store all your NFTs securely and avoid phishing attacks into your wallets.

## Build Your Own Storefront / Marketplace:

The marketplace will allow users to create their storefronts. This marketplace will allow users to upload, publish, and sell their minted NFTs. The marketplace will use the underlying protocol level logic to govern the demand & pricing mechanism to control the NFT auction & transactions.
Additional benefits of this marketplace are that economic principles of supply and demand become automatically integrated into the system, allowing the community to determine the fair price of user-generated assets.

## Storage Mechanism
-   We use a dedicated IPFS gateway to store the asset and associated metadata.
-   We verify the assets using IPFS to prove the authenticity of the minted NFTs.
