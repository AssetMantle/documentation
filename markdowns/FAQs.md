Our mission is to bring equity, consolidation, and democratization to a highly technical and fragmented sector by serving as a one-stop-shop connecting NFT Creators and Consumers in Web3 & IRL. MantlePlace, powered by CosmosSDK-based mantleChain and a genuinely sympathetic no-bullshit UI, makes it simple to upload & manage your assets on the blockchain without needing to write any code or be tech-savvy.

**Launch Your Art Simply:** 
To launch your NFT collection with MantlePlace, you only need two things: your artwork i.e., assets & its metadata, secondly, MantlePlace username & password. MantlePlace handles everything else, including the Collection homepage setup, creating New Collections & their NFT (metadata) schema, Creating NFTs, Whitelist creation & management, minting & trading, decentralization of information via provenance, list Private & Public sales on the NFT launchpad and much more.

In the same way, there are curation mechanisms in place to give priority to legitimate collectors and block malicious actors, scripts, and bots.

 
**We Make Deployment Dirt-Cheap**
When deploying a collection on Ethereum or other Layer-1s, gas costs might be expensive; we've streamlined our code to make launching your NFT collection cheaper than any other deployment protocols. You do not need to pay three-digit $ gas fees to mint and trade NFTs, assuring a sustainable system that can be adopted by a diverse set of people, thus easing the entrance of users into the NFT market. 
 
**Manage Ownership Simply via NFT Wallet** 
NFT Wallet within MantlePlace is a multi-faceted creator-centric dashboard facilitating NFT wallet & sales management mechanisms.  A central location to gauge self-created NFT Collections; Add new NFT assets, Create New NFTs (metadata + assets), list Public and Private sales. It has a Whitelist facility for private and exclusive trades, as well as a Wishlist NFTs section to explore and purchase all the NFTs you've hearted while surfing MantlePlace. 
 
**Discoverability** 
Finding an audience for your artwork in an increasingly diverse and complex market can be difficult, requiring lengthy hours of Twitter and Instagram browsing. MantlePlace leverages blockchain information, expert thought leaders, gamification mechanisms and data analytics to ensure that your artwork is found by the correct collectors. 
 
**Your Art (and its data) is Immortalized** 
We progressively decentralize your artwork and metadata (always stored on-chain) so that it is never dependent on a single server for the preservation of an NFT. Your work will live on eternally due to decentralized storage systems'embodying the provenance trait and larger sovereign philosophy, which are fully embraced by the team when developing on the mantleChain and therefore imbuing MantleProducts with the sovereign ethos.

## FAQ
**How do I list my collection on MantlePlace?**
If you already have a MantlePlace account, log in and go to the NFT Wallet section. There, you can create a Curated Collection, add metadata to relevant pieces (Create NFT), and set up a sale (public or private). 

For Creators whose collections have been vetted and given the green light to be made ‘live’ by the MantlePlace team can list the collection for a Private or Public sale via the NFT launchpad. You can't list a sale unless you are a Genesis or Post Genesis Mantle Creator, However, the rest of the features, like making a collection or minting an NFT, are free to use. 
 
**What is a completed NFT asset?** 
An NFT asset (audio, video, image, gif) is something that is uploaded within a NFT Collection which is later initialized with metadata (property-type & their values) as per defined NFT Collection schema via Create NFTs facility. Post which, it is a complete NFT that is ready to be minted via sales-listing.  
 
**Do you have a limit on how many art-pieces (per collection) can be uploaded?**
You can upload a total of 10,000 NFTs per Collection

**Is it possible to stop my mint campaign?**
It’s not possible to stop your Private or Public Sale (mint) as it is on-chain & their timeline & price metrics are immutable until the listing runs out, you will have to wait until the sales-listing has expired to re-list the NFTs according to new metrics 
 
**Is it possible to edit the NFT mint price and Collection-timeline (calibration) once collection goes live?**
It is not possible to edit the NFT mint-price or edit the mint-timeline once a Collection’s Private or Public Sale Listing campaign is deployed, since it is on-chain – you will have to wait until the listing expires.  
 
**Is it possible to run 2 sales parallel to each other?** 
Yes, you can list private sale (backed by whitelists) & public sale parallel to each other- but not of the same kind. 
No, you cannot run two parallel public sales, you would have to wait for one to expire and then re-list with new metrics. However, you can contingently schedule a new public sale for when the existing one expires.

**What is the Maximum Number of wallets for the Whitelist?**
Maximum number of wallet address provision on the Watchlist is set to a ceiling of 100,000 wallet per Whitelist 
 
**Can I edit the Whitelist once it has been created?** 
Yes, you can edit the whitelist metrics once it has been formalized 
 
**Do you have a burn mechanism?** 
NFT assets on MantlePlace come with a pre-built burn mechanism, whose burn value or bond amount is directly proportional to the NFT metadata contained in it.  Burning the NFTs will redeem the owner of the NFTs with $MNTL that is equivalent to the metadata within the NFT asset (to know more about Bond Amount & NFT metadata - refer the section below) - if you desire to create burn-to-redeem experiences, or anything of the like, MantlePlace supports it.

**I want to offer a certain number of mints for free, then the rest at a price I set. Is this possible?** 
Yes, you can offer free mints on select number of NFTs via private sales-listing backed by Whitelists, setting the price as $0 (or $0.000001) on the whitelist price metric and propagating the whitelist link to be minted essentially for free. The rest of the NFTs in the collection can be publicly listed for a relevant average price & ADD 
 
**Can I randomize my minting order?**
The mint order for NFT Collections pools for Public and Private listings are always Randomized by Default for any Collection as per the protocol, hence deemed as Blind Mints, we do this to provide equal grounds for users to mint the rarest of NFTs on MantlePlace 
 
**What are the platform fees and other on-chain operational costs for creators?** 
The platform fee is 2.5% per standard transaction. Currently, as part of the Early Access program, there is no transaction fee. In the future, all sales (minting) and secondary sales on MantlePlace will be levied the standard 2.5% platform fee.  

**How are the Bonding fees of an NFT asset calculated?**
Bonding Fee (Amount) is tied to the NFT asset (Metadata) which is directly proportional to its metadata(number of metadata & types of them present), on burning an NFT the owner will receive the bond amount in their MantlePlace wallet. 

**How do people mint my collection once its live (public)?** 
The collectors and general users can access the Public Sales listing from the Explore page or Early Access Page or a similar campaign-based subsection on the MantlePlace Front-page UI.  
Private Sales & Whitelist can be accessed by the link provided to the collection by the Creator  
 
**Is my supply of NFTs public to users during mint?** 
The supply of created NFT assets is publicly examinable (not the particular pieces) but the Randomized Collection Pool metrics. You can gauge the total NFT assets in the project, the NFT assets in a particular sale, NFT assets sold from a particular sale, their average token price and lastly, the sales timeline. 
 
*For Example, A Ferrari NFT Collection has a total of 444 NFT assets (30 are sold in a previous sale) of which 150 NFT assets from the Collection assets have been created into a completed NFT asset with their metadata (property name & property values), 80 are deemed set aside for Sales listing #2. 
When you make a (default-randomized) Public or Private Sale with 80 NFT assets (Max NFTs ‘80’ option – sales metrics) from the 444 Ferrari Collection (150 Completed NFT Randomized Pool)- the MantlePlace algorithm will Randomize the listing for the 80 NFTs out of from the total 150 COMPLETE NFT assets with their metadata.  
The stats will read the following: 
Total NFTs: 444 (30 already sold) 
Total ‘Complete’ & Ready-to-deploy NFT assets: 150 
Total listed for Sale #2: 80/150 
Total Future NFT set after Sale #2: 444-30-80 = 334 
In the case that all 80 does not get minted during the sale, the unsold bunch will be rerouted to the randomized future sales-pool.*

**Can I add more pieces (assets) to my Collection after it’s deployed**?   
Yes, you can add more NFT assets & completed NFTs (with metadata) to a Collection according to the pre-defined NFT schema once collection is live/deployed. Note you cannot add more NFT assets on the front ends before initiatilizing the rest of the already added NFT assets with their metadata
 
**Can I use a tablet, phone or iPad to upload images to MantlePlace?** 
Yes, you can use a tablet or a phone to upload NFT Assets and their metadata onto MantlePlace. However, for a quality and seamless experience, we recommend creators to use the web-app version of MantlePlace 
 
**I hosted a drop with Whitelist but not all of my NFTs were minted in the Whitelist stage.**  
In this case, the NFTs on the Private-sales (Whitelist) that haven't been sold just go into the randomized NFT pool for contingent listing. For example, if you have a collection of 15 pieces and 10 of them are set aside for the Whitelist stage at 0 $MNTL and 5 of them are set aside for the public sales listing. Post Whitelist-based Private-sale - say you only sold 5 NFTs on the Whitelist stage, then 10 (5 +5) NFTs will be available on the randomized listing for future sales listing - residue is always transfered into the randomized sales pool

**Will the ‘filename’ #3 metadata that we put in the metadata sheet be shown on Platform for a specific NFT or is it just the ‘Name’ that will be shown?** 
The NFT asset name 'Name' as per NFT Collection Schema aka sample metadata structure (Property / Metadata #1) will appear, not the entity's (NFT asset) filename.  

**Is it possible to change the metadata after the mint?**
No, it is not possible to edit the metadata after minting an NFT from a certain Collection or after Creating an NFT (initializing with metadata), metadata values can be altered during the NFT creation process according to the freedom provided by the Collection NFT schema on MantlePlace. Post creating, minting & trading an NFT; the property values (metadata) of the entity cannot be modified unless a certain metadata(s) (property type & value) has been made mutable as per Collections defined NFT schema by the issuer/creator of the NFT collection 
 
**Do you support video, Gifs and audio?** 
MantlePlace allows the upload and NFT creation of assets in Audio, Video, GIF and Image formats.

**Can I use your platform for airdrops?**
Yes, you can use the MantlePlace for airdrops through the Whitelist facility where you can curate crowds and schedule drops through calibrating timelines (can set price 0.00001 in public and private sale with max token per user set to 1 or more). 1v1 Airdrop facility for NFTs are in the build, mechanism will be appended with future chain upgrades

**Can I reduce the size of my Collection after (Public / Private) sales-listing has been deployed?** 
No, you cannot alter the size of Collection deemed for Listing (Private/Public) once the listing is live, you will have to wait for the sales-listing to expire, post which, you can set the MAX NFTs a lower number and re-list the same.  
However, while a certain sale is live, you can add more NFT assets to the Collection, initialize metadata (create NFT), which will increase the number of total NFTs in the Collection but these newly created NFTs would not be slotted into the already listed private/public sale randomized NFT pool, it would be available for future sales-listing in the randomized NFT pool. 
 
**How would someone change their launch date for their upcoming collection?** 
Unless the sales-listing is live, creators can set the future timeline and schedule a sales-listing contingently. If the sales listing is live with the timeline already calibrated then one would have to wait out the duration until expiry and schedule a contingent sale for the same 
 
**Where can I preview my Collection page?** 
You can preview the various (self-created) NFTs collections on the Collection’s page that can be accessed from the NFT Wallet (creator dashboard)– click on User-symbol on the top right corner, from the drop-down menu click on NFT Wallet and then click on Created (sub-section) to see a list of all your Collections or Create new Collection or Add NFT assets to a created NFT collection 

**Can you promote my work on your Twitter?** 
As a component of our creator support mechanism, AssetMantle provides a co-marketing strategy to nurture your community and helps push Creator works to the Mantle community via our high ROI yielding Socials, primarily Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and other secondary socials that we leverage for maximum network effect. 
 

**People are unable to mint the maximum mint I’ve set on my collection. What’s going on?** 
1. Transaction failure 
2. Insufficient funds 
3. Server issues 
 

**Do you support free mints? What proceeds do you take in this case?** 
Yes, we support free mints. All you have to do is input your price as 0 (or 0.00001 $MNTL) within a Public or whitelist-based Private sales-listing. In a normal instance we accrue the platform fees which is set at a standard of 2.5% per transaction, currently there is no platform operation fee for minting or trading because of early-access initiative - subject to change with governance proposals & time. 

**How do I create Whitelist drop?** 
Head on over to MantlePlace, sign in and arrive at the multi-facet Creator Dashboard via clicking the NFT Wallet option by hovering on the user-symbol on the top-right-corner. Next head on over to the Whitelist (sub-section) and click on Create New and input required information (Whitelist-name, description, member-cap and calibrating) and confirm to receive the Whitelist Invitation Link. Hurray, now you have a Whitelist created 

**Can I reduce the price of my Collection (NFT assets) once it has launched?** 
No, you cannot reduce the average price once the sale is live, only after the sale has expired, you can re-launch a new sale with revamped prices. 

**Does MantlePlace support auctions?**
Yes, we do support a slew of auctions such as Dutch & English auctions on the secondary marketplace of MantlePlace. 

**I want to do a 3000 items generative collection on Mantleplace Can I reserve a part of the supply (say 500 NFTs) for myself?** 
Yes, you can reserve a portion of the NFTs from a said Collection for yourself; You would just have to list (a portion) 2500 of the 3000 NFTs in a sales-listing. However, the hindsight is you cannot save particular NFTs for yourself, the entire Collection is randomized during a sales-listing. 

**Can I launch more than one collection from my wallet?**
Yes, you can create and list numerous NFT Collections with diverse customizable metadata NFT (Collection) schema from the same wallet based decentralized identity (DID)

**(In the airdrop phase, can I decide which specific NFTs to send?** 
Not at this point! Unfortunately, traits of batch minting is as such that you cannot select specific NFTs) 
 
**Does the gas price change depend on the size of my collection?** 
No gas-price does not vary according to Collections, it is standardized to be equitable, price-efficient, & Creator centric, MantlePlace charges negligible gas-fee (less than $0.10), being one of the lowest gas-gurgling NFT framework (marketplace) across the blockchain ecosystem 
 
**Why isn’t my Collection showing up on marketplaces like Omniflix or Stargaze?** 
AssetMantle uses a different NFT standard as compared to other Cosmos-hub chains such as Stargaze, or Irisnet. AssetMantle uses interNFT standard to mint and facilitate NFT operations on MantlePace whilst the likes of Omniflix (oNFT ) and Stargaze (SG721) use a variation of the ICS 721 framework or CosmosSDK modules facilitation for NFT minting & management.  
When the CosmosSDK, IBCs interchain interoperable standards, modules & facilitations mature to a certain extent it will inherently be possible to inter-mingle marketplaces and NFT Collections within the Cosmos-hub (app-chains) 
 
**Can I update the artwork and name of my Collection once I have Deployed a Listing?** 
No, you cannot update the Name of the NFT Collection once the Collection has been Deployed/sales-listed – on-chain, it is immutable once the NFT Collection Schema for a Collection is defined. If you want to re-name a Collection, advise is to delete the current Collection, re-create a New Collection with the required Name, Description & NFT Collection schema for the same & proceed given that you have not listed any NFTs under the said NFT Collection (& its NFT Collection Schema)
 
**What is a DID (Decentralized Identity) & how is metadata separated from NFT (image asset)?** 
DIDs are Identifiers and are separate the metadata (DID Subject) and the NFT (DID Object: image asset in PNG or JPEG) stored in IPFS or on-chain. Let’s say x is the DID subject (metadata) & y is the DID object (NFT document).  
The DID document is just metadata about the x. NFT is the DID Object (y) and is not the DID or DID Subject metadata (x) but rather DID (denom) is a pointer, pointing towards the NFT (y) and metadata (x) is defining the NFT.  
Basically, DID (denom) points towards the NFT asset (x) and the metadata document (y) which defines the NFT (x), DID (denom) pointer is separate from the NFT asset (y) & its metadata (x).
